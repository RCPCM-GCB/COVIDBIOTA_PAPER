### get the data
```{r}
meta = read.delim("../DATA/metadata_eng_lineage.tsv")
meta$sample = rownames(meta16s)
```


```{r}
table(meta$lineage)
```


### run Fisher test
```{r}
library(reshape2)
lin_city_long = data.frame(lineage = meta$lineage, city = meta$city)
lin_city_long = lin_city_long[complete.cases(lin_city_long),]
lin_city_wide = dcast(lin_city_long, city ~ lineage)

rownames(lin_city_wide) = lin_city_wide$city
lin_city_wide = lin_city_wide[,-1]
fisher.test(lin_city_wide, simulate.p.value=TRUE, B=1e5)
```
